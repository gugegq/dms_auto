TermsAndConditions=As a part of your User Profile, you are encouraged to upload a self image. This is entirely optional and we make no requirement to upload a photo in order to use this website. If you choose to upload a profile picture in your User Profile, please be sure your photograph is proper & professional. Recommended profile pictures would be in your normal business attire or everyday working wardrobe. Self portraits that render the best are a simple, full color head shot. A head shot is a photographic technique where the focus of the photograph is a person's face. A headshot is a specific type of portrait and is an image that portrays a person as he or she truly looks. In contrast to the head shot, an environmental portrait would portray a person with elements of his life such as his work, interests, etc. Use of an image with a large background or cluttered backdrop like in an environmental portrait will not render well, due to the small size of the displayed image on this website and these are not recommended. Any photo you upload cannot violate or infringe upon the rights of authors, patents, trademarks or trade secrets, or the property, intellectual, privacy, personality or publicity rights of a third party. The image you upload in your User Profile will be visible to other users in the website, which will help identify you as the person in the recognition card or nomination event. Any recognition activities that you initiate or receive will display your image. Likewise, if you receive recognition from another user who has elected to upload a photo in their profile, you will be able to see their image. When you elect to use the social share feature for recognition you receive, your profile image will be displayed in links to other websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, etc. Please be aware that any links to other websites from the Inspirus website are not protected under our terms & conditions or privacy policy.
